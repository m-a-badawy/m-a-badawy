Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mohamed Badawy
I'm a backend engineer with a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming â€“ primarily in C++. Recently, Iâ€™ve expanded my skills to include JavaScript and Node.js, and I'm diving deeper into MySQL, MongoDB, and Docker to broaden my backend development toolkit.

Hereâ€™s a bit about what I do and where I'm headed:

ðŸŒ± Currently learning: Database design with MySQL and MongoDB, efficient data handling, and containerization with Docker
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Data structures, algorithms, and OOP concepts â€” always happy to discuss efficient solutions and share insights
ðŸš€ Projects: Iâ€™m working on practical, scalable projects to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, from building APIs to designing data-driven applications.
I'm excited to connect with other developers, exchange knowledge, and contribute to the community. Letâ€™s collaborate and keep growing together!
